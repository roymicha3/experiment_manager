# Experiment Manager - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

<context>
# Overview
Experiment Manager aims to be the definitive solution for managing machine learning experiments by providing researchers and engineers with a structured, configurable, and extensible framework that addresses the common challenges of ML experimentation: organization, reproducibility, tracking, and analysis.

Machine learning experimentation is inherently complex and iterative, presenting several key challenges:
- **Experiment Organization**: Running multiple experiments with different configurations quickly becomes disorganized
- **Configuration Management**: Tracking which parameters produced which results is difficult without a structured approach
- **Results Tracking**: Collecting and comparing metrics across experiments is time-consuming without proper systems
- **Reproducibility**: Recreating the exact conditions of a successful experiment is often challenging
- **Resource Management**: Organizing artifacts, checkpoints, and logs can become unwieldy as experiments multiply
- **Collaboration**: Sharing experiments and results among team members lacks standardization
- **Pipeline Complexity**: Training workflows with early stopping, checkpointing, and metrics tracking require substantial boilerplate code

```

## Hierarchical Levels and Context Management System

### The Six-Level Experiment Hierarchy

The Experiment Manager implements a sophisticated six-level hierarchy that provides structured context for both tracking and execution. This hierarchical design enables precise organization and granular control over experiment data and workflow.

```python
class Level(Enum):
    EXPERIMENT    = 0  # Top-level experiment container
    TRIAL         = 1  # Individual experiment configurations  
    TRIAL_RUN     = 2  # Single execution of a trial (with repetition support)
    PIPELINE      = 3  # Execution context for training workflows
    EPOCH         = 4  # Individual training epochs within a pipeline
    BATCH         = 5  # Individual batch processing (finest granularity)
```

#### Level Definitions and Business Purpose

1. **EXPERIMENT Level (0)**:
   - **Business Purpose**: Overall experiment coordination and high-level research objectives

   - **Tracked Data**: Batch metrics, gradient information, detailed debugging data

### Context-Based Component Architecture: Callbacks vs Trackers

A fundamental architectural decision is the **context-based separation** between callbacks and trackers, which serves different purposes in the system:

#### Callbacks: Pipeline-Context Components

```python
class Callback(ABC):
    def on_start(self) -> None:
        """Called when pipeline training starts."""
        
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch_idx: int, metrics: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        """Called at end of each epoch. Return False to stop training."""
        
    def on_end(self, metrics: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        """Called when pipeline training ends."""
```

**Business Purpose**: Real-time training intervention and workflow control
**Technical Context**: Operate exclusively within PIPELINE level boundaries
**Key Responsibilities**:
- **Training Decision Making**: Early stopping, learning rate adjustments, model pruning
- **Immediate Intervention**: Real-time responses to training state changes
- **Workflow Management**: Setup, epoch processing, cleanup within training context
- **Resource Management**: Checkpoint saving, model evaluation, optimization state management

**User Value**: 
- Automated training optimization without manual intervention
- Consistent training workflows across different experiments
- Extensible training logic without modifying core pipeline code

#### Trackers: Multi-Level Context Components

```python
class Tracker(ABC):
    def on_create(self, level: Level, *args, **kwargs):
        """Called when an entity at any level is created."""
        
    def on_start(self, level: Level, *args, **kwargs):
        """Called when an entity at any level starts execution."""
        
    def on_end(self, level: Level, *args, **kwargs):
        """Called when an entity at any level completes."""
        
    def on_add_artifact(self, level: Level, artifact_path: str, *args, **kwargs):
        """Called when artifacts are associated with any level."""
```

**Business Purpose**: Comprehensive experiment data collection and analysis support
**Technical Context**: Operate across ALL hierarchy levels (EXPERIMENT through BATCH)
**Key Responsibilities**:
- **Data Collection**: Metrics, artifacts, metadata collection across all levels
- **Persistent Storage**: Database records, log files, external system integration
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Maintaining relationships between experiment entities
- **Cross-Experiment Analysis**: Supporting research insights across multiple experiments
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all experiment activities

**User Value**:
- Complete experiment reproducibility and audit trails
- Cross-experiment comparison and analysis capabilities
- Integration with external tools (MLflow, TensorBoard, databases)
- Long-term experiment data management and insights

### Design Benefits of Context Separation

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**:
   - **Callbacks**: Focus solely on training logic and real-time intervention
   - **Trackers**: Focus solely on data collection and long-term persistence

2. **Different Temporal Scopes**:
   - **Callbacks**: Immediate, real-time decisions within bounded training execution
   - **Trackers**: Long-term data management spanning entire experiment lifecycle

3. **Orthogonal Extensibility**:
   - Training workflows can be customized through callbacks without affecting data collection
   - Tracking backends can be modified without impacting training logic
   - Both can be extended independently based on user needs

4. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Callbacks can be unit tested with mock training states
   - Trackers can be tested independently with mock level events
   - Clear separation makes debugging and maintenance easier

### Advanced Design Patterns

#### TrackScope Context Manager

The system uses sophisticated context management for automatic level lifecycle tracking:

```python
class TrackScope:
    def __init__(self, tracker_manager: TrackerManager, level: Level, *args, **kwargs):
        self.tracker_manager = tracker_manager
        self.level = level
    
    def __enter__(self):
        self.tracker_manager.on_start(self.level, *self.args, **self.kwargs)
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        self.tracker_manager.on_end(self.level)
```

**Business Value**: Eliminates manual tracking lifecycle management, reducing user errors
**Technical Benefits**: Exception-safe cleanup, automatic hierarchical transitions, simplified user code

#### Property-Based Lazy Resource Management

The Environment class implements lazy directory creation using properties:

```python
@property
def log_dir(self):
    log_dir_path = os.path.join(self.workspace, ProductPaths.LOG_DIR.value)
    if not os.path.exists(log_dir_path):
        os.mkdir(log_dir_path)
    return log_dir_path
```

**Business Value**: Reduces setup complexity and eliminates common filesystem errors
**Technical Benefits**: Lazy evaluation, automatic resource management, consistent directory structure

#### Hierarchical Workspace Organization

The framework implements a workspace structure that mirrors the logical experiment hierarchy:

```
workspace/
├── experiment_name/          # EXPERIMENT level
│   ├── configs/             
│   ├── logs/               
│   ├── artifacts/          
│   └── trials/             
│       ├── trial_1/         # TRIAL level
│       │   ├── configs/    
│       │   ├── logs/       
│       │   ├── artifacts/  
│       │   └── run_1/       # TRIAL_RUN level
│       │       ├── logs/   
│       │       └── artifacts/
```

**Business Value**: Intuitive organization that matches mental model of experiments
**Technical Benefits**: Logical isolation, easy artifact discovery, scalable organization

#### Child Environment Creation Pattern

The system uses inheritance with isolation for hierarchical resource management:

```python
def create_child(self, name: str, args: DictConfig = None) -> 'Environment':
    child_workspace = os.path.join(self.workspace, name)
    child_env = self.__class__(
        workspace=child_workspace,
        config=self.config,
        factory=self.factory,
        # ... inherited properties with isolated workspace
        tracker_manager=self.tracker_manager.create_child(child_workspace))
```

**Business Value**: Consistent configuration inheritance with proper isolation
**Technical Benefits**: Resource sharing, configuration propagation, isolated execution contexts
